## 1. Reconnaissance

- [ ] Perform initial nmap scan
  - [ ] Quick scan: `nmap -p- --min-rate=1000 -T4 <IP>`
  - [ ] Detailed scan: `nmap -sC -sV -p <open ports> <IP>`
- [ ] Check for common web ports (80, 443, 8080, etc.)
- [ ] Investigate any other open ports
- [ ] Use additional tools based on open ports (e.g., gobuster, nikto)

## 2. Enumeration

- [ ] Web enumeration (if applicable)
  - [ ] Directory busting
  - [ ] Check for hidden files/directories
  - [ ] Inspect source code
  - [ ] Check for common vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, etc.)
- [ ] Service enumeration
  - [ ] Identify versions and potential vulnerabilities
  - [ ] Check for misconfigurations
- [ ] User enumeration (if possible)

## 3. Exploitation

- [ ] Research potential exploits based on enumeration results
- [ ] Prepare and test exploit code in a safe environment
- [ ] Execute the exploit
- [ ] Gain initial foothold

## 4. Post-Exploitation

- [ ] Stabilize shell (if necessary)
- [ ] Perform local enumeration
  - [ ] Check user privileges
  - [ ] Look for sensitive files
  - [ ] Identify potential privilege escalation vectors
- [ ] Attempt privilege escalation
- [ ] Locate and capture flags

## 5. Persistence (Optional)

- [ ] Establish persistence mechanism (if allowed by CTF rules)
- [ ] Create additional access methods

## 6. Cleanup

- [ ] Remove any added files or modifications
- [ ] Clear logs (if allowed by CTF rules)

## 7. Documentation

- [ ] Document all steps taken
- [ ] Note any interesting findings or techniques used
- [ ] Prepare write-up (if required)

## 8. Review and Learn

- [ ] Analyze the attack process
- [ ] Identify areas for improvement
- [ ] Research alternative methods or tools


## 9. Notes
